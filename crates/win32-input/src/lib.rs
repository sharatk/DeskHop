//! Low-level hooks, Raw Input, `SendInput`, cursor warp, DPI.
//!
//! One of two crates where `unsafe` is allowed. Every `unsafe` block carries a
//! `// SAFETY:` comment. Hook procedures do nothing but enqueue: Windows
//! silently unhooks a slow low-level hook. Linked only by `bin/agent`.
//!
//! # Use
//!
//! [`start`] installs the hooks and returns a [`Capture`] and a receiver of
//! [`Captured`] events: local input with its time and [`Origin`], and the
//! [`Screen`] whenever it changes. [`Capture::set_mode`] decides which
//! physical input the hooks keep from the OS; [`Capture::inject`] and
//! [`Capture::warp`] carry out the engine's decisions. Dropping the
//! [`Capture`] returns to [`CaptureMode::PassAll`] and removes the hooks.
//!
//! # Threads
//!
//! The input thread owns both low-level hooks and the Raw Input window and
//! does nothing else, so a hook call never waits behind slow work. The
//! screen thread enumerates monitors on display-change messages and every
//! 2 seconds, and reports only a screen that differs from the last one.
//!
//! # Origin
//!
//! Keys, buttons and wheel take their origin from the hooks' injected flags.
//! Motion comes from Raw Input, before pointer speed: input carrying
//! DeskHop's tag ([`decide::TAG`]) is injected, input with a device handle
//! is physical, and anything else follows the last move the mouse hook saw.
